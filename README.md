Wav2Spectrum is a simple application which takes a small chunk (window) from input wav and outputs the frequencies one by one (a sweep) into another wav file.

It is very useful to hear the harmonics (one by one) from a sound. It can be used as a spectrum tool for the blind people who are interested in sound analysis.

Run with "-h" argument for help.

Requirements: numpy, scipy
